# Overview
### Bots---->
Bots are software programs that combine requests, which are typically provided as text, with contextual data, such as geolocation and payment information, to appropriately handle the request and respond. Bots are often also called "chatbots", "assistants" or "agents." Bot is simple a program that do work for you automatically .So python Bot is a similar thing which is written in python using various modules of python and you can do your work automate .

### Building the Bot
#### Pre-requisites
A hands-on knowledge of scikit library and NLTK is assumed. However, if you are new to NLP, you can still read the article and then refer back to resources.
NLP
The field of study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers is called Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short. It sits at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics. NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.
### Rasa Open Source

Rasa is an open source machine learning framework to automate text-and voice-based conversations. With Rasa, you can build contextual assistants on:
* Facebook Messenger
* Slack
* Google Hangouts
* Webex Teams
* Microsoft Bot Framework
* Rocket.Chat
* Mattermost
* Telegram
* Twilio
* Your own custom conversational channels 
or voice assistants as:
* Alexa Skills
* Google Home Actions
Rasa helps you build contextual assistants capable of having layered conversations with lots of back-and-forth. In order for a human to have a meaningful exchange with a contextual assistant, the assistant needs to be able to use context to build on things that were previously discussed – Rasa enables you to build assistants that can do this in a scalable way.


#### NLTK: A Brief Introduction 
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. NLTK has been called “a wonderful tool for teaching and working in, computational linguistics using Python,” and “an amazing library to play with natural language.” Natural Language Processing with Python provides a practical introduction to programming for language processing.

#### Downloading and installing NLTK
Install NLTK: run pip install nltk
Test installation: run python then type import nltk

#### Installing NLTK Packages
Import NLTK and run nltk.download().This will open the NLTK downloader from where you can choose the corpora and models to download. You can also download all packages at once.
Text Pre- Processing with NLTK
The main issue with text data is that it is all in text format (strings). However, the Machine learning algorithms need some sort of numerical feature vector in order to perform the task. So before we start with any NLP project we need to pre-process it to make it ideal for working. Basic text pre-processing includes:
Converting the entire text into uppercase or lowercase, so that the algorithm does not treat the same words in different cases as different
Tokenization: Tokenization is just the term used to describe the process of converting the normal text strings into a list of tokens i.e words that we actually want. Sentence tokenizer can be used to find the list of sentences and Word tokenizer can be used to find the list of words in strings.
The NLTK data package includes a pre-trained Punkt tokenizer for English.
Removing Noise i.e everything that isn’t in a standard number or letter.
Removing Stop words. Sometimes, some extremely common words which would appear to be of little value in helping select documents matching a user need are excluded from the vocabulary entirely. These words are called stop words
Stemming: Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base or root form — generally a written word form. Example if we were to stem the following words: “Stems”, “Stemming”, “Stemmed”, “and Stemtization”, the result would be a single word “stem”.
Lemmatization: A slight variant of stemming is lemmatization. The major difference between these is, that, stemming can often create non-existent words, whereas lemmas are actual words. So, your root stem, meaning the word you end up with, is not something you can just look up in a dictionary, but you can look up a lemma. Examples of Lemmatization are that “run” is a base form for words like “running” or “ran” or that the word “better” and “good” are in the same lemma so they are considered the same.
